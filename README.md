# A Python Exercise

**This is a simple python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the second semester class Discrete mathematics_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A program that accepts as an input a permutation in a list format from natural numbers separated by the space character (eg 7 10 9 11 2 1 3 5 6 8 4) and prints the permutation rank in the lexicographic order of all same length permutations.
>
>>A program that accepts two integers n and k as inputs and prints the permutation of [n] which is at position k in the lexicographic order of all its permutations of [n].

> #### About this project
>
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the .py archive
> - This program runs for Python version 3.6+
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
